Argument Clinic
===============

Argument clinic is a simple comment server written in node. It has a few primary goals:

1. **Easy** to self-host. Designed to run for free on [glitch](glitch.com)
2. Privacy Focused. **Absolutely no tracking.**
3. Simple open-api. Doesn't require magic js include.
4. You own the data. Sqlite backed, but easy to import/export.
